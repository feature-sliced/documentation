- [Knowledge types in the project](/docs/about/understanding/knowledge-types.md): The following "types of knowledge" can be distinguished in any project:
- [Naming](/docs/about/understanding/naming.md): Different developers have different experiences and contexts, which can lead to misunderstandings on the team when the same entities are called differently. For example:
- [Needs driven](/docs/about/understanding/needs-driven.md): — Can't you formulate the goal that the new feature will solve? Or maybe the problem is that the task itself is not formulated? **The point is also that the methodology helps to pull out the problematic definition of tasks and goals**
- [Signals of architecture](/docs/about/understanding/signals.md): If there is a limitation on the part of the architecture, then there are obvious reasons for this, and consequences if they are ignored
- [Branding Guidelines](/docs/branding.md): FSD's visual identity is based on its core-concepts: Layered, Sliced self-contained parts, Parts & Compose, Segmented.
- [Decomposition cheatsheet](/docs/get-started/cheatsheet.md): Use this as a quick reference when you're deciding how to decompose your UI. PDF versions are also available below, so you can print it out and keep one under your pillow.
- [FAQ](/docs/get-started/faq.md): You can ask your question in our Telegram chat, Discord community, and GitHub Discussions.
- [Overview](/docs/get-started/overview.md): Feature-Sliced Design (FSD) is an architectural methodology for scaffolding front-end applications. Simply put, it's a compilation of rules and conventions on organizing code. The main purpose of this methodology is to make the project more understandable and stable in the face of ever-changing business requirements.
- [Tutorial](/docs/get-started/tutorial.md): Part 1. On paper
- [Handling API Requests](/docs/guides/examples/api-requests.md): handling-api-requests}
- [Authentication](/docs/guides/examples/auth.md): Broadly, authentication consists of the following steps:
- [Autocomplete](/docs/guides/examples/autocompleted.md): About decomposition by layers
- [Browser API](/docs/guides/examples/browser-api.md): About working with the Browser API: localStorage, audio Api, bluetooth API, etc.
- [CMS](/docs/guides/examples/cms.md): Features may be different
- [Feedback](/docs/guides/examples/feedback.md): Errors, Alerts, Notifications, ...
- [i18n](/docs/guides/examples/i18n.md): Where to place it? How to work with this?
- [Metric](/docs/guides/examples/metric.md): About ways to initialize metrics in the application
- [Monorepositories](/docs/guides/examples/monorepo.md): About applicability for mono repositories, about bff, about microapps
- [Page layouts](/docs/guides/examples/page-layout.md): This guide examines the abstraction of a page layout — when several pages share the same overall structure, and differ only in the main content.
- [Desktop/Touch platforms](/docs/guides/examples/platforms.md): About the application of the methodology for desktop/touch
- [SSR](/docs/guides/examples/ssr.md): About the implementation of SSR using the methodology
- [Theme](/docs/guides/examples/theme.md): Where should I put my work with the theme and palette?
- [Types](/docs/guides/examples/types.md): This guide concerns data types from typed languages like TypeScript and describes where they fit within FSD.
- [White Labels](/docs/guides/examples/white-labels.md): Figma, brand uikit, templates, adaptability to brands
- [Cross-imports](/docs/guides/issues/cross-imports.md): Cross-imports appear when the layer or abstraction begins to take too much responsibility than it should. That is why the methodology identifies new layers that allow you to uncouple these cross-imports
- [Desegemented](/docs/guides/issues/desegmented.md): Situation
- [Excessive Entities](/docs/guides/issues/excessive-entities.md): The entities layer in Feature-Sliced Design is one of the lower layers that's primarily for business logic. That makes it widely accessible — all layers except for shared can access it. However, its global nature means that changes to entities can have a widespread impact, requiring careful design to avoid costly refactors.
- [Routing](/docs/guides/issues/routes.md): Situation
- [Migration from a custom architecture](/docs/guides/migration/from-custom.md): This guide describes an approach that might be helpful when migrating from a custom self-made architecture to Feature-Sliced Design.
- [Migration from v1 to v2](/docs/guides/migration/from-v1.md): Why v2?
- [Migration from v2.0 to v2.1](/docs/guides/migration/from-v2-0.md): The main change in v2.1 is the new mental model for decomposing an interface — pages first.
- [Usage with Electron](/docs/guides/tech/with-electron.md): Electron applications have a special architecture consisting of multiple processes with different responsibilities. Applying FSD in such a context requires adapting the structure to the Electron specifics.
- [Usage with Next.js](/docs/guides/tech/with-nextjs.md): FSD is compatible with Next.js in both the App Router version and the Pages Router version if you solve the main conflict — the app and pages folders.
- [Usage with NuxtJS](/docs/guides/tech/with-nuxtjs.md): It is possible to implement FSD in a NuxtJS project, but conflicts arise due to the differences between NuxtJS project structure requirements and FSD principles:
- [Usage with React Query](/docs/guides/tech/with-react-query.md): The problem of “where to put the keys”
- [Usage with SvelteKit](/docs/guides/tech/with-sveltekit.md): It is possible to implement FSD in a SvelteKit project, but conflicts arise due to the differences between the structure requirements of a SvelteKit project and the principles of FSD:
- [Docs for LLMs](/docs/llms.md): This page provides links and guidance for LLM crawlers.
- [Layers](/docs/reference/layers.md): Layers are the first level of organisational hierarchy in Feature-Sliced Design. Their purpose is to separate code based on how much responsibility it needs and how many other modules in the app it depends on. Every layer carries special semantic meaning to help you determine how much responsibility you should allocate to your code.
- [Public API](/docs/reference/public-api.md): A public API is a contract between a group of modules, like a slice, and the code that uses it. It also acts as a gate, only allowing access to certain objects, and only through that public API.
- [Slices and segments](/docs/reference/slices-segments.md): Slices
- [Feature-Sliced Design](/index.md): Architectural methodology for frontend projects
