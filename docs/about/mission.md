# Mission

Here we describe the goals and limitations of the applicability of the methodology-which we are guided by when developing the methodology

* We see our goal as a balance between ideology and simplicity
* We won't be able to make a silver bullet that fits everyone

**Nevertheless, the methodology should be close and accessible to a fairly wide range of developers**

## Goals[​](#goals "Direct link to heading")

### Intuitive clarity for a wide range of developers[​](#intuitive-clarity-for-a-wide-range-of-developers "Direct link to heading")

The methodology should be accessible - for most of the team in projects

*Because even with all the future tools , it will not be enough, if only experienced seniors/leads will understand the methodology*

### Solving everyday problems[​](#solving-everyday-problems "Direct link to heading")

The methodology should set out the reasons and solutions to our everyday problems when developing projects

**And also-attach tools to all this (cli, linters)**

So that developers can use a *battle-tested* approach that allows them to bypass long-standing problems of architecture and development

> *@sergeysova: Imagine, that a developer writes code within the framework of the methodology and he has problems 10 times less often, simply because other people have thought out the solution to many problems.*

## Limitations[​](#limitations "Direct link to heading")

We do not want to *impose our point of view*, and at the same time we understand that *many of our habits, as developers, interfere from day to day*

Everyone has their own level of experience in designing and developing systems, **therefore, it is worth understanding the following:**

* **Will not work**: very simple, very clear, for everyone

  > *@sergeysova: Some concepts cannot be intuitively understood until you encounter problems and spend years solving them.*
  >
  > * *In math world: is graph theory.*
  > * *In physics: quantum mechanics.*
  > * *In programming: application architecture.*

* **Possible and desirable**: simplicity, extensibility
