# About architecture

## Problems[​](#problems "Sarlavhaga to'g'ridan-to'g'ri havola")

Usually, the conversation about architecture is raised when the development stops due to certain problems in the project.

### Bus-factor & Onboarding[​](#bus-factor--onboarding "Sarlavhaga to'g'ridan-to'g'ri havola")

Only a limited number of people understand the project and its architecture

**Examples:**

* *"It's difficult to add a person to the development"*
* *"For every problem, everyone has their own opinion on how to get around" (let's envy the angular)*
* *"I don't understand what is happening in this big piece of monolith"*

### Implicit and uncontrolled consequences[​](#implicit-and-uncontrolled-consequences "Sarlavhaga to'g'ridan-to'g'ri havola")

A lot of implicit side effects during development/refactoring *("everything depends on everything")*

**Examples:**

* *"The feature imports the feature"*
* *"I updated the store of one page, and the functionality fell off on the other"*
* *"The logic is smeared all over the application, and it is impossible to track where the beginning is, where the end is"*

### Uncontrolled reuse of logic[​](#uncontrolled-reuse-of-logic "Sarlavhaga to'g'ridan-to'g'ri havola")

It is difficult to reuse/modify existing logic

At the same time, there are usually [two extremes](https://github.com/feature-sliced/documentation/discussions/14):

* Either the logic is written completely from scratch for each module *(with possible repetitions in the existing codebase)*
* Either there is a tendency to transfer all-all implemented modules to `shared` folders, thereby creating a large dump of modules *from it (where most are used only in one place)*

**Examples:**

* *"I have **N** implementations of the same business logic in my project, for which I still pay"*
* *"There are 6 different components of the button/pop-up/... In the project"*
* *"Dump of helpers"*

## Requirements[​](#requirements "Sarlavhaga to'g'ridan-to'g'ri havola")

Therefore, it seems logical to present the desired *requirements for an ideal architecture:*

note

Wherever it says "easy", it means "relatively easy for a wide range of developers", because it is clear that [it will not be possible to make an ideal solution for absolutely everyone](/documentation/uz/docs/about/mission.md#limitations)

### Explicitness[​](#explicitness "Sarlavhaga to'g'ridan-to'g'ri havola")

* It should be **easy to master and explain** the project and its architecture to the team
* The structure should reflect the real **business values of the project**
* There must be explicit **side effects and connections** between abstractions
* It should be **easy to detect duplicate logic** without interfering with unique implementations
* There should be no **dispersion of logic** throughout the project
* There should not be **too many heterogeneous abstractions and rules** for a good architecture

### Control[​](#control "Sarlavhaga to'g'ridan-to'g'ri havola")

* A good architecture should **speed up the solution of tasks, the introduction of features**

* It should be possible to control the development of the project

* It should be easy to **expand, modify, delete the code**

* The \* decomposition and isolation of\*\* functionality must be observed

* Each component of the system must be **easily replaceable and removable**

  * *[No need to optimize for changes](https://youtu.be/BWAeYuWFHhs?t=1631) - we can't predict the future*
  * *[Better-optimize for deletion](https://youtu.be/BWAeYuWFHhs?t=1666) - based on the context that already exists*

### Adaptability[​](#adaptability "Sarlavhaga to'g'ridan-to'g'ri havola")

* A good architecture should be applicable **to most projects**

  * *With existing infrastructure solutions*
  * *At any stage of development*

* There should be no dependence on the framework and platform

* It should be possible to **easily scale the project and the team**, with the possibility of parallelization of development

* It should be easy **to adapt to changing requirements and circumstances**
