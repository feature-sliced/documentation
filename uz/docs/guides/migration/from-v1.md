# Migration from v1 to v2

## Why v2?[​](#why-v2 "Sarlavhaga to'g'ridan-to'g'ri havola")

The original concept of **feature-slices** [was announced](https://t.me/feature_slices) in 2018.

Since then, many transformations of the methodology have taken place, but at the same time **[the basic principles were preserved](https://feature-sliced.github.io/featureslices.dev/v1.0.html)**:

* Using a *standardized* frontend project structure
* Splitting the application in the first place-according to *business logic*
* Use of *isolated features* to prevent implicit side effects and cyclic dependencies
* Using the *Public API* with a ban on climbing "into the insides" of the module

At the same time, in the previous version of the methodology, there were still **weak points** that

* Sometimes it leads to boilerplate code
* Sometimes it leads to excessive complication of the code base and non-obvious rules between abstractions
* Sometimes it leads to implicit architectural solutions, which prevented the project from being pulled up and new people from onboarding

The new version of the methodology ([v2](https://github.com/feature-sliced/documentation)) is designed **to eliminate these shortcomings, while preserving the existing advantages** of the approach.

Since 2018, [has also developed](https://github.com/kof/feature-driven-architecture/issues) another similar methodology - [**feature-driven**](https://github.com/feature-sliced/documentation/tree/rc/feature-driven), which was first announced by [Oleg Isonen](https://github.com/kof).

After merging of the two approaches, we have **improved and refined existing practices** - towards greater flexibility, clarity and efficiency in application.

> As a result, this has even affected the name of the methodology - *"feature-slice**d**"*

## Why does it make sense to migrate the project to v2?[​](#why-does-it-make-sense-to-migrate-the-project-to-v2 "Sarlavhaga to'g'ridan-to'g'ri havola")

> `WIP:` The current version of the methodology is under development and some details *may change*

#### 🔍 More transparent and simple architecture[​](#-more-transparent-and-simple-architecture "Sarlavhaga to'g'ridan-to'g'ri havola")

The methodology (v2) offers **more intuitive and more common abstractions and ways of separating logic among developers.**

All this has an extremely positive effect on attracting new people, as well as studying the current state of the project, and distributing the business logic of the application.

#### 📦 More flexible and honest modularity[​](#-more-flexible-and-honest-modularity "Sarlavhaga to'g'ridan-to'g'ri havola")

The methodology (v2) allows **to distribute logic in a more flexible way:**

* With the ability to refactor isolated parts from scratch
* With the ability to rely on the same abstractions, but without unnecessary interweaving of dependencies
* With simpler requirements for the location of the new module *(layer => slice => segment)*

#### 🚀 More specifications, plans, community[​](#-more-specifications-plans-community "Sarlavhaga to'g'ridan-to'g'ri havola")

At the moment, the `core-team` is actively working on the latest (v2) version of the methodology

So it is for her:

* there will be more described cases / problems
* there will be more guides on the application
* there will be more real examples
* in general, there will be more documentation for onboarding new people and studying the concepts of the methodology
* the toolkit will be developed in the future to comply with the concepts and conventions on architecture

> Of course, there will be user support for the first version as well - but the latest version is still a priority for us
>
> In the future, with the next major updates, you will still have access to the current version (v2) of the methodology, **without risks for your teams and projects**

## Changelog[​](#changelog "Sarlavhaga to'g'ridan-to'g'ri havola")

### `BREAKING` Layers[​](#breaking-layers "Sarlavhaga to'g'ridan-to'g'ri havola")

Now the methodology assumes explicit allocation of layers at the top level

* `/app` > `/processes` > **`/pages`** > **`/features`** > `/entities` > `/shared`

* *That is, not everything is now treated as features/pages*

* This approach allows you to [explicitly set rules for layers](https://t.me/atomicdesign/18708):

* The **higher the layer** of the module is located , the more **context** it has

  *(in other words-each module of the layer - can import only the modules of the underlying layers, but not higher)*

* The **lower the layer of the** module is located , the more **danger and responsibility** to make changes to it

  *(because it is usually the underlying layers that are more overused)*

### `BREAKING` Shared[​](#breaking-shared "Sarlavhaga to'g'ridan-to'g'ri havola")

The infrastructure abstractions `/ui`, `/lib`, `/api`, which used to lie in the src root of the project, are now separated by a separate directory `/src/shared`

* `shared/ui` - Still the same general uikit of the application (optional)
  <!-- -->
  * *At the same time, no one forbids using `Atomic Design` here as before*
* `shared/lib` - A set of auxiliary libraries for implementing logic
  <!-- -->
  * *Still - without a dump of helpers*
* `shared/api` - A common entry point for accessing the API
  <!-- -->
  * *Can also be registered locally in each feature / page - but it is not recommended*
* As before - there should be no explicit binding to business logic in `shared`
  * *If necessary, you need to take this relationship to the `entities` level or even higher*

### `NEW` Entities, Processes[​](#new-entities-processes "Sarlavhaga to'g'ridan-to'g'ri havola")

In v2 **, other new abstractions** have been added to eliminate the problems of logic complexity and high coupling.

* `/entities` - layer **business entities** containing slices that are related directly to the business models or synthetic entities required only on frontend
  <!-- -->
  * *Examples: `user`, `i18n`, `order`, `blog`*

* `/processes` - layer **business processes**, penetrating app

  <!-- -->

  * **The layer is optional**, it is usually recommended to use it when *the logic grows and begins to blur in several pages*
  * *Examples: `payment`, `auth`, `quick-tour`*

### `BREAKING` Abstractions & Naming[​](#breaking-abstractions--naming "Sarlavhaga to'g'ridan-to'g'ri havola")

Now specific abstractions and [clear recommendations for naming them](/documentation/uz/docs/about/understanding/naming.md)are defined

#### Layers[​](#layers "Sarlavhaga to'g'ridan-to'g'ri havola")

* `/app` — **application initialization layer**
  * *Previous versions: `app`, `core`,`init`, `src/index` (and this happens)*
* `/processes` — [**business process layer**](https://github.com/feature-sliced/documentation/discussions/20)
  * *Previous versions: `processes`, `flows`, `workflows`*
* `/pages` — **application page layer**
  * *Previous versions: `pages`, `screens`, `views`, `layouts`, `components`, `containers`*
* `/features` — [**functionality parts layer**](https://github.com/feature-sliced/documentation/discussions/23)
  * *Previous versions: `features`, `components`, `containers`*
* `/entities` — [**business entity layer**](https://github.com/feature-sliced/documentation/discussions/18#discussioncomment-422649)
  * *Previous versions: `entities`, `models`, `shared`*
* `/shared` — [**layer of reused infrastructure code**](https://github.com/feature-sliced/documentation/discussions/31#discussioncomment-453020) 🔥
  <!-- -->
  * *Previous versions: `shared`, `common`, `lib`*

#### Segments[​](#segments "Sarlavhaga to'g'ridan-to'g'ri havola")

* `/ui` — [**UI segment**](https://github.com/feature-sliced/documentation/discussions/31#discussioncomment-453132) 🔥
  <!-- -->
  * *Previous versions: `ui`, `components`, `view`*
* `/model` — [**BL-segment**](https://github.com/feature-sliced/documentation/discussions/31#discussioncomment-472645) 🔥
  <!-- -->
  * *Previous versions: `model`, `store`, `state`, `services`, `controller`*
* `/lib` — segment **of auxiliary code**
  * *Previous versions: `lib`, `libs`, `utils`, `helpers`*
* `/api` — [**API segment**](https://github.com/feature-sliced/documentation/discussions/66)
  * *Previous versions: `api`, `service`, `requests`, `queries`*
* `/config` — **application configuration segment**
  * *Previous versions: `config`, `env`, `get-env`*

### `REFINED` Low coupling[​](#refined-low-coupling "Sarlavhaga to'g'ridan-to'g'ri havola")

Now it is much easier to [observe the principle of low coupling](/documentation/uz/docs/reference/slices-segments.md#zero-coupling-high-cohesion) between modules, thanks to the new layers.

*At the same time, it is still recommended to avoid as much as possible cases where it is extremely difficult to "uncouple" modules*
