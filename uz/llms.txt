- [Needs driven](/docs/about/understanding/needs-driven.md): ‚Äî Can't you formulate the goal that the new feature will solve? Or maybe the problem is that the task itself is not formulated? **The point is also that the methodology helps to pull out the problematic definition of tasks and goals**

- [Qisqacha](/docs/get-started/overview.md): Feature-Sliced Design (FSD) bu front-end ilovalarining tuzilishini shakllantirish uchun arxitektura metodologiyasi. Oddiy qilib aytganda, bu kodni tartibga solish uchun qoidalar va konvensiyalar to'plami. Bu metodologiyaning asosiy maqsadi - loyihani yanada tushunarli va o'zgaruvchan biznes talablariga moslashuvchan qilishdir.

- [White Labels](/docs/guides/examples/white-labels.md): Figma, brand uikit, templates, adaptability to brands
- [Cross-imports](/docs/guides/issues/cross-imports.md): Cross-imports appear when the layer or abstraction begins to take too much responsibility than it should. That is why the methodology identifies new layers that allow you to uncouple these cross-imports

- [Routing](/docs/guides/issues/routes.md): Situation

- [Migration from v2.0 to v2.1](/docs/guides/migration/from-v2-0.md): The main change in v2.1 is the new mental model for decomposing an interface ‚Äî pages first.
- [Usage with Electron](/docs/guides/tech/with-electron.md): Electron applications have a special architecture consisting of multiple processes with different responsibilities. Applying FSD in such a context requires adapting the structure to the Electron specifics.
- [Usage with Next.js](/docs/guides/tech/with-nextjs.md): FSD is compatible with Next.js in both the App Router version and the Pages Router version if you solve the main conflict ‚Äî the app and pages folders.
- [Usage with NuxtJS](/docs/guides/tech/with-nuxtjs.md): It is possible to implement FSD in a NuxtJS project, but conflicts arise due to the differences between NuxtJS project structure requirements and FSD principles:

- [Public API](/docs/reference/public-api.md): A public API is a contract between a group of modules, like a slice, and the code that uses it. It also acts as a gate, only allowing access to certain objects, and only through that public API.
