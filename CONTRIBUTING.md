## Workflow

[self-review-article]: https://blog.beanbaginc.com/2014/12/01/practicing-effective-self-review/

1. [Fork][fork] the repository
2. Make your changes
   - Make sure that **commits follow** the [Conventional Commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org)
      > All this helps with the changelog formation and keeps the history of the project clean
      >
      > *It would also be useful to indicate in each commit (preferably in the body) the ID of the task in the format `#{ID}' (so that there is linking)*
   - Make sure that **all checks pass**

      ```sh
      $ npm run test
      # > Linting is not broken
      # > The build does not crash
      ```

   - To modify/add markdown tables, it is recommended to use ready-made services (for example [this](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables))
3. [Open your pull-request][pr-new] from *your forked branch* and specify related [issues][issues] (if any)
   - Before creating a PR do at least one [`self-review`][self-review-article] of your changes, to save the reviewers' time
   - Also make sure that you describe the problem being solved as clearly as possible (take care of the reviewer) in your PR
      > The more details you provide in the description, the better
      >
      > *You can get acquainted with [what pull-requests were made before you][pr]*
   - If everything is fine, you can ping someone from the core maintainers to speed things up
      > If you have any problems, you can temporarily convert your PR into a draft (see the panel on the right)
      >
      > Or mark the PR title with the prefix 'WIP:`

   - Make sure that the verification via **[CI][actions]** has passed for your PR
      > Our common goal is to reduce review costs and achieve consistency in the code base 🤙
