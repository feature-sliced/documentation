# Knowledge types in the project

The following "types of knowledge" can be distinguished in any project:

* **Fundamental knowledge**  
  Knowledge that does not change much over time, such as algorithms, computer science, programming language mechanisms and its APIs.

* **Technology stack**  
  Knowledge of the set of technical solutions used in a project, including programming languages, frameworks, and libraries.

* **Project knowledge**  
  Knowledge that is specific to the current project and not valuable outside of it. This knowledge is essential for newly-onboarded developers to be able to contribute effectively.

:::note

**Feature-Sliced Design** is designed to reduce reliance on "project knowledge", take more responsibility, and make it easier to onboard new team members.
