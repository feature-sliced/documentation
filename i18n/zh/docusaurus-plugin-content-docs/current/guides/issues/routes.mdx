# Routing

<WIP ticket="169" />

## Situation

Urls to pages are hardcoded in the layers below pages

```tsx title="entities/post/card"

<Card>
    <Card.Title 
        href={`/post/${data.id}`}
        title={data.name}
    />
    ...
</Card>
```

## Problem

Urls are not concentrated in the page layer, where they belong according to the scope of responsibility

## If you ignore it

Then, when changing urls, you will have to keep in mind that these urls (and the logic of urls/redirects) can be in all layers except pages

And it also means that now even a simple product card takes part of the responsibility from the pages, which smears the logic of the project

## Solution

Determine how to work with urls/redirects from the page level and above

Transfer to the layers below via composition/props/factories
