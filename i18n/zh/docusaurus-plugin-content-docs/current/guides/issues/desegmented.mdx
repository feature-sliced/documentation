# Desegemented

<WIP ticket="148" />

## Situation

Very often, there is a situation on projects when modules related to a specific domain from the subject area are unnecessarily desegmented and scattered around the project

```sh
├── components/
|    ├── DeliveryCard
|    ├── DeliveryChoice
|    ├── RegionSelect
|    ├── UserAvatar
├── actions/
|    ├── delivery.js
|    ├── region.js
|    ├── user.js
├── epics/
|    ├── delivery.js
|    ├── region.js
|    ├── user.js
├── constants/
|    ├── delivery.js
|    ├── region.js
|    ├── user.js
├── helpers/
|    ├── delivery.js
|    ├── region.js
|    ├── user.js
├── entities/
|    ├── delivery/
|    |      ├── getters.js
|    |      ├── selectors.js
|    ├── region/
|    ├── user/
```

## Problem

The problem manifests itself at least in violation of the principle of * * High Cohesion** and excessive stretching * * of the axis of changes**

## If you ignore it

- If necessary, touch on the logic, for example, delivery - we will have to keep in mind that it lies in several places and touch on several places in the code-which unnecessarily stretches our * * Axis of changes**
- If we need to study the logic of the user, we will have to go through the whole project to study in detail * * actions, epics, constants, entities, components** - instead of it lying in one place
- Implicit connections and the uncontrollability of a growing subject area
- With this approach, the eye is very often blurred and you may not notice how we "create constants for the sake of constants", creating a dump in the corresponding project directory

## Solution

Place all modules related to a specific domain/user case - directly next to each other

So that when studying a particular module, all its components lie side by side, and are not scattered around the project

> It also increases the discoverability and clarity of the code base and the relationships between modules
