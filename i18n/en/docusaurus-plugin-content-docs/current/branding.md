# Branding Guidelines

FSD's visual identity is based on its core-concepts: `Layered`, `Sliced self-contained parts`, `Parts & Compose`, `Segmented`.
But also we tend to design simple, pretty identity, which should convey the FSD philisophy and be easy to recognize.

**Please, use FSD's identity "as-is", without changes but with our assets for your comfort.** This brand guide will help you to use FSD's identity correctly.

:::caution Compatibility

FSD had [another legacy identity](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11Y-3qZ_C9jOFoW2UbSp11YasOhw4yBdl?usp=sharing) before. Old design didn't represent core-concepts of methodology. Also it was created as pure draft, and should have been actualized.

For a compatible and long-term use of the brand, we have been carefully rebranding for a year (2021-2022). **So that you can be sure when using identity of FSD 🍰**

*But prefer namely actual identity, not old!*

## Title

- ✅ **Correct:** `Feature-Sliced Design`, `FSD`
- ❌ **Incorrect:** `Feature-Sliced`, `Feature Sliced`, `FeatureSliced`, `feature-sliced`, `feature sliced`, `FS`

## Emojii

The cake 🍰 image represents FSD core concepts quite well, so it has been chosen as our signature emoji

> Example: *"🍰 Architectural design methodology for Frontend projects"*

## Logo & Palette

FSD has few variations of logo for different context, but it recommended to prefer **primary**
