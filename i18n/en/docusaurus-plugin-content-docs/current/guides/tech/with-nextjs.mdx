# Usage with NextJS

It is possible to implement FSD in a NextJS project, but conflicts arise due to differences between the requirements for the NextJS project structure and the principles of FSD in two points: 

- Routing files in the `pages` layer
- Conflict or absence of the `app` layer in NextJS

## Conflict between FSD and NextJS on `pages` layer {#pages-conflict}


NextJS suggests using the `pages` folder to define application routes. NextJS expects files in the `pages` folder to match URLs.
This routing mechanism **does not correspond** to the FSD concept, since it is not possible to maintain a flat slice structure in such a routing mechanism.

### Moving the `pages` folder of NextJS to the root folder of the project (recommended)

The approach is to move the `pages` NextJS folder to the root folder of the project and import the FSD pages into the `pages` NextJS folder. This saves
the FSD project structure inside the `src` folder.

```sh
├── pages              # NextJS pages folder
├── src
│   ├── app
│   ├── entities
│   ├── features
│   ├── pages          # FSD pages folder
│   ├── shared
│   ├── widgets
```

### Renaming the `pages` layer within the FSD structure

Another way to solve the problem is to rename the `pages` layer in the FSD structure to avoid conflicts with the NextJS `pages` folder.
You can rename the `pages` layer in FSD to `views`.
In that way, the structure of the project in the `src` folder is preserved without contradiction with the requirements of NextJS.

```sh
├── app
├── entities
├── features
├── pages              # NextJS pages folder
├── views              # Renamed FSD pages folder
├── shared
├── widgets
```

Keep in mind that it's highly recommended to document this rename prominently in your project's README or internal documentation. This rename is a part of your ["project knowledge"][project-knowledge].

## The absence of the `app` folder in NextJS {#app-absence}

In NextJS below version 13, there is no explicit `app` folder, instead NextJS provides the `_app.tsx` file,
which plays the role of a wrapping component for all project pages.

### Importing app functionality to `pages/_app.tsx` file

To solve the problem of missing the `app` folder in the NextJS structure, you can create an `App` component inside the `app` layer and import the `App` component into `pages/_app.tsx` so that NextJS can work with it.
For example:

```tsx
// app/providers/index.tsx

const App = ({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) => {
  return (
    <Provider1>
      <Provider2>
        <BaseLayout>
            <Component {...pageProps} />
        </BaseLayout>
      </Provider2>
    </Provider1>
  );
};

export default App;
```
Then you can import the `App` component and global project styles into `pages/_app.tsx` as follows:

```tsx
// pages/_app.tsx

import 'app/styles/index.scss'

export { default } from 'app/providers';
```

## Dealing with App Router {#app-router}

App Router has become stable in NextJS version 13.4. App Router allows you to use the `app` folder for routing instead of the `pages` folder.
To comply with the principles of FSD, you should treat the NextJS `app` folder in the same way as recommended
to resolve a conflict with the NextJS `pages` folder.

The approach is to move the NextJS `app` folder to the root folder of the project and import the FSD pages into the NextJS `app` folder. This saves
the FSD project structure inside the `src` folder. You should still also add the `pages` folder to the root, because the App router is compatible with the Pages router.

```
├── app                # NextJS app folder
├── pages              # Stub NextJS pages folder
│   ├── README.md      # Description of why this folder exists
├── src
│   ├── app            # FSD app folder
│   ├── entities
│   ├── features
│   ├── pages          # FSD app folder
│   ├── shared
│   ├── widgets
```
