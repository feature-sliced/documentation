<WIP ticket="179" />

> (for entities such spraying PTS released)
>
> 2) Common service types that you can segelerite - same-react-app-env.d.ts
>
> 3) And if you have service types and you need to import right everywhere, then it's not critical especially, you can also put it in shared, you can also put it next to react-app.env.dts
