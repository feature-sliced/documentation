# Abstractions

<WIP ticket="186" />

## The law of leaky abstractions

## Why are there so many abstractions

> Abstractions help to cope with the complexity of the project. The question is - will these abstractions be specific only for this project, or will we try to derive general abstractions based on the specifics of the frontend

> Architecture and applications in general are inherently complex, and the only question is how to better distribute and describe this complexity

## About scopes of responsibility

> About optional abstractions
