FSD is compatible with Next.js in both the App Router version and the Pages Router version if you solve the main conflict — the `app` and `pages` folders.

## App Router \{#app-router\}

### Conflict between FSD and Next.js in the `app` layer \{#conflict-between-fsd-and-nextjs-in-the-app-layer\}

Next.js suggests using the `app` folder to define application routes. It expects files in the `app` folder to correspond to pathnames. This routing mechanism **does not align** with the FSD concept, as it's not possible to maintain a flat slice structure.

The solution is to move the Next.js `app` folder to the project root and import FSD pages from `src`, where the FSD layers are, into the Next.js `app` folder.

You will also need to add a `pages` folder to the project root, otherwise Next.js will try to use `src/pages` as the Pages Router even if you use the App Router, which will break the build. It's also a good idea to put a `README.md` file inside this root `pages` folder describing why it is necessary, even though it's empty.

<FileTree>
- app App folder (Next.js)
  - api
    - get-example
      - route.ts
  - example
    - page.tsx
- pages Empty pages folder (Next.js)
  - README.md

    - api-routes API routes

      - index.ts
      - ui
        - example.tsx
  - widgets/
  - features/
  - entities/
  - shared/
</FileTree>

Example of re-exporting a page from `src/pages` in the Next.js `app`:

```tsx title="app/example/page.tsx"
export { ExamplePage as default, metadata } from '@/pages/example';
```

### Middleware \{#middleware\}

If you use middleware in your project, it must be located in the project root alongside the Next.js `app` and `pages` folders.

### Instrumentation \{#instrumentation\}

The `instrumentation.js` file allows you to monitor the performance and behavior of your application. If you use it, it must be located in the project root, similar to `middleware.js`.

## Pages Router \{#pages-router\}

### Conflict between FSD and Next.js in the `pages` layer \{#conflict-between-fsd-and-nextjs-in-the-pages-layer\}

Routes should be placed in the `pages` folder in the root of the project, similar to `app` folder for the App Router. The structure inside `src` where the layer folders are located remains unchanged.

<FileTree>
- pages Pages folder (Next.js)
  - _app.tsx
  - api
    - example.ts API route re-export
  - example
    - index.tsx
- src
  - app
    - custom-app
      - custom-app.tsx Custom App component
    - api-routes
      - get-example-data.ts API route
  - pages
    - example
      - index.ts
      - ui
        - example.tsx
  - widgets/
  - features/
  - entities/
  - shared/
</FileTree>

Example of re-exporting a page from `src/pages` in the Next.js `pages`:

```tsx title="pages/example/index.tsx"
export { Example as default } from '@/pages/example';
```

### Custom `_app` component \{#custom-_app-component\}

You can place your Custom App component in `src/app/_app` or `src/app/custom-app`:

```tsx title="src/app/custom-app/custom-app.tsx"
import type { AppProps } from 'next/app';

export const MyApp = ({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) => {
    return (
        <>
            <p>My Custom App component</p>
            <Component { ...pageProps } />
        </>
    );
};
```

```tsx title="pages/_app.tsx"
export { App as default } from '@/app/custom-app';
```

## Route Handlers (API routes) \{#route-handlers-api-routes\}

Use the `api-routes` segment in the `app` layer to work with Route Handlers.

Be mindful when writing backend code in the FSD structure — FSD is primarily intended for frontends, meaning that's what people will expect to find.
If you need a lot of endpoints, consider separating them into a different package in a monorepo.

<TabItem value="app-router" label="App Router">

```tsx title="src/app/api-routes/get-example-data.ts"
import { getExamplesList } from '@/shared/db';

export const getExampleData = () => {
    try {
        const examplesList = getExamplesList();

        return Response.json({ examplesList });
    } catch {
        return Response.json(null, {
            status: 500,
            statusText: 'Ouch, something went wrong',
        });
    }
};
```

```tsx title="app/api/example/route.ts"
export { getExampleData as GET } from '@/app/api-routes';
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="pages-router" label="Pages Router">

```tsx title="src/app/api-routes/get-example-data.ts"
import type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next';

const config = {
    api: {
        bodyParser: {
            sizeLimit: '1mb',
        },
    },
    maxDuration: 5,
};

const handler = (req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse<ResponseData>) => {
    res.status(200).json({ message: 'Hello from FSD' });
};

export const getExampleData = { config, handler } as const;
```

```tsx title="src/app/api-routes/index.ts"
export { getExampleData } from './get-example-data';
```

```tsx title="app/api/example.ts"
import { getExampleData } from '@/app/api-routes';

export const config = getExampleData.config;
export default getExampleData.handler;
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Additional recommendations \{#additional-recommendations\}

- Use the `db` segment in the `shared` layer to describe database queries and their further use in higher layers.
- Caching and revalidating queries logic is better kept in the same place as the queries themselves.
